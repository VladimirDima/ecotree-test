## Usage
<!-- requirements: 
node last version
npm-run-all
-->
```shell
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/VladimirDima/ecotree-test.git
cd ecotree-test

# Install dependencies
npm i

# Compile Sass
npm run css-compile

For the most straightforward development, open two Terminal tabs to execute `npm run server` and `npm run watch` at the same time.

# Watch Sass for changes (uses nodemon)
npm run watch

# Start local server (uses sirv-cli)
npm run server

# Watches Sass for changes and starts a local server
npm start
```
